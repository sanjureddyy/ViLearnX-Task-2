# ViLearnX-Task-3

SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Create a Python program that functions as a basic calculator. The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Implement functionality to execute the selected operation and handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero). Display the result of the operation to the user in a clear and user-friendly format. This task will help you practice Python programming, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations. Use an IDE or text editor like PyCharm or VS Code for development.
